Hey there XXXXXXXX!

I was just cruising around the web Github and StackOverflow, and I found what you've been up to on the software engineering front.

We're actively hiring for killer engineering team here in Berlin and Hamburg, and based on what you've been doing, I think you'd be interested in what some of our clients are up to. I can see that you might be happily employed, however I am wondering if some "special" opportunity came up like with companies from Silicon Valley (eBay, Soundcloud, Yelp) would you still turn it down or would you at least take a look at them?

Thanks,

XXXX XXXX,
